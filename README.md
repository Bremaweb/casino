Casino
======

This mod has the goal to implement several mini-games into the minetest world. It uses as dependency
the money or money2 mod and as optional dependency the chatplus or eChat (wip) mod.

The current version 70665 has the beginning of a lotto mod within it, where the user can buy a ticket
and has to choose a number within a specified range. Each user has a ticket limit (default 4)
and will be informed via chatplus/eChat if he/she has won. The user then has to go to a second machine
to receive the amound of credits. In case of multiple winners, the jackpot is divided to give
each of them the same amount.

Planned features
================

> Lotto
> Slotmachines
> Card Games (Black Jack or something like that)


Crafting
========

Though this mod works with global jackpots, each user can craft machines for this mod. This is on purpose
to give the minerals zinc/tin a specific use since they only have one recipe per ore. Besides, on this way
the users are allowed to build casinos on their own.


ToDo
====

> Important!
Lookup if it is allowed to include such games within a OpenSource game without touching real currency.
